# Project-Wallet
Project goal was to test an application that records income and expenditure transactions
Our team aimed to test an application that records income and expenditure transactions. Our group had six testers, and our testing period lasted for a week. We conducted several types of tests, such as static, API (Swagger), functional, usability, accessibility, and reliability tests.

We executed 77 test cases in the PC environment, out of which:

- 39 **failed**, 

- one was **blocked**, 

- 37 **passed**. 

Besides PC testing, we also performed smoke tests on mobile devices, where we executed 38 test cases, out of which

- 18 **failed**,

- 20 **passed**. 

After conducting a thorough analysis, we concluded that the application was still in the early Alpha phase and required further refinement. 
The biggest issues we faced were poor application performance, lack of documentation, and inconsistencies between the mockups and the product. 

Conducting tests after work, in the evenings, or late at night was the most significant challenge we faced due to the availability of project participants. However, Agile methodology and daily stand-up meetings helped us address this challenge, along with clear task delegation and role assignment. In the project, I served as the Scrum Master and was responsible for organizing and conducting daily meetings.
